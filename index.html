                <p>My name is Aisa Szakal, and I’m from Budapest, Hungary.<br>
                    I began studying ICT because I wanted to learn more about technology and the 
                    way the world goes forward to. Now, my interests have expanded to the design 
                    part as well, where I can express my creative ideas visually.<br>
                    I took a course about artificial intelligence, and statics so I can balance 
                    both my creative and analytical skills. I'm passionate about learning new 
                    things and enjoy challenging both sides of my brain.<br>
                    I am a curious and innovative person, throug my previous projects I realised, 
                    that I enjoy doing research and then developing it into a media product (video,
                    sound recording).<br>
                    I feel like I have a sense for beauty, which might be a cause effect of my interest for arts from a young age.
                    However, I believe this is a great skill to have for anything that is design related.

                    2024.06.<br>
                    Today I recorded a podcast.<br>
                    Recently I have been curious about the differences, 
                    and shifts between the generations, so I wanted to know more.<br>
                    I invited a writer who I had known, has a bigger knowledge about the generations and technology, 
                    and a person who represented the Z-generation. I was incredibly nervous before the record, 
                    but I felt prepared, I conducted research beforehand, I made a plan for the podcast, I knew how the microphone worked.<br>
                    And of course, I bought drinks and snacks for the guests.

                    “Selling” a website is not so easy especially if it is about a city, but me and my group decided to have fun while working, 
                    and the fact that we targeted international students in the end it wasn’t even that uninspiring.
                    In this project, I had the task of working on the design of the project, which means making products as offline marketing for 
                    explorebreda.nl. Since my group decided to target international students, I knew that our posters must be fun,
                    striking, and simple (since young adults I think mainly look after the simplest but most eye-catching things).

                    After I wrote a book, I thought I would challange myself, and learn, how to create an animation video.
                    The clock was ticking, since I had two weeks to finish with this media product, but since I already had the story, at least, 
                    I didn't have to write a scenario.
                    Throughout this creation, I could learn a lot about animation methods, editing, and alltogether I learned how to imagine something
                    and create it "physically".
